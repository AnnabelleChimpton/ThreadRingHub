# Ring Hub Service - Build TODO

This document outlines the complete implementation plan for building Ring Hub, a neutral, protocol-first service for hosting and federating ThreadRings across the web.

## üéØ Project Overview

**Vision**: Create a decentralized ThreadRing protocol that allows any website, blog, or platform to participate in ThreadRings without being locked into a single platform.

**Core Principles**:
- Protocol-first design (not platform-specific)
- Minimal data storage (metadata and references only)
- Cryptographically secure (HTTP signatures)
- Federation-ready from day one
- Performance at scale

**Timeline**: 10 weeks (mapped to Personal Project Plan Weeks 1-10)
- **Weeks 1-2**: Foundation & Core Framework (Project Weeks 1-2)
- **Weeks 3-4**: Core Operations & Content Systems (Project Weeks 3-4)  
- **Weeks 5-6**: Advanced Features & Developer Tools (Project Weeks 5-6)
- **Weeks 7-9**: Federation & External Platform Support (Project Weeks 7-9)
- **Week 10**: Production Deployment & Launch (Project Week 10)

## üìö Implementation Notes & Best Practices

### Development Guidelines
- **Security First**: All write operations require HTTP signature authentication
- **Protocol Design**: Build for federation from day one, avoid platform lock-in
- **Performance**: Implement caching at every layer (Redis, CDN, application)
- **Scalability**: Design for horizontal scaling with stateless services
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage including security and federation scenarios
- **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date API docs and integration guides

### Key Technical Decisions
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for reliability and JSON support for flexible schemas
- **Authentication**: Ed25519 HTTP signatures for cryptographic security
- **Caching**: Redis for distributed caching with appropriate TTL strategies
- **API**: OpenAPI-first design for consistency and auto-generated tooling
- **Federation**: ActivityPub for standards-based cross-instance communication

### Architecture Principles
- **Minimal Data Storage**: Only metadata and references, never full content
- **Immutable Audit Logs**: All moderation actions permanently recorded
- **Cryptographic Verification**: All badges and membership records signed
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues operating with reduced functionality during outages
- **Privacy by Design**: Never widen post visibility scope, respect all privacy settings
